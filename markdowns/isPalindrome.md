# Palindrome

A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forward and backward. 
For example, `rotor` and `redder` are palindromes, but `motor` is not.

How can you use recursion to determine whether a word is a palindrome? 

?[What would be the base case?]
-[ ] A string with two identical letters
-[ ] A string with one character
-[x] An empty string


::: What would be the recursive case? 

Think of converting the original problem to a sub-problem of smaller size.
